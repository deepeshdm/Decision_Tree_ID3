In order to apply this algorithm efficiently you must follow certain criteria.

1] The last column of the dataset should contain the target / label classes.

2] Also the last column should be named as "label"

The algorithm uses only numpy & pandas as dependencies

Caution : The efficiency of the model is directly related to the number of label classes you have.
A large number of label classes also results an exponential growth in data splitting which is computationally expensive.
